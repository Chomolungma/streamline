This is an experimental branch of Streamline.

There will be a new parts list and new walkthrough as well. 

It reduces the parts cost and increases quality by switching to RTX generation GeForce cards rather than older Quadros. 

We will drop one bitrate lane to be able to use a Geforce instead of a quadro, 1440p. It's unclear if that is even really worth the extra uplink bandwidth.

We also add simultaneous creation of MPEG-DASH streaming alongside HLS. You can now use either protocol, with Shaka Player being added as the DASH player. 

TODOs

Run through install a few times and polish up any issues. 

Make the low latency server auto run at boot. 

Clean up the low latency player page.
